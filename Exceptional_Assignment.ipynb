        "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-An Exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program (i.e., at runtime). When an exception occurs, Python stops the normal flow of the program and executes the associated exception handling code (if provided).\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Exceptions occur at runtime, while syntax errors occur before the program starts running (during code parsing).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Exceptions happen due to unexpected situations, like dividing by zero or trying to open a file that doesn’t exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Syntax errors happen due to incorrect code structure, like missing colons, parentheses, or indentation mistakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Syntax errors must be fixed before running the code, otherwise the program won’t start at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, ValueError, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.Examples of syntax errors include writing if True print(\"Hello\") (missing colon) or print(\"Hello\" (missing closing parenthesis).\n"
